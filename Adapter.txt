Adapter 

Adapter makes interfact compatible to another interface
Facade hides complex logic and provides you with interface
Proxy intercepts the call and thus control access the underlying object. Usecase - caching, security etc.
Decorator adds behaviour to object it is decorating.

More use cases of Adapter

If in future you want to change the adaptee you can easily change that by changing the wrapper code around it.
So Client actually calls adaptee but adapter sits between it.
Adapter code can change in future to delegate request to new adaptee and keeping the underlying code same like whole application still calls adapter method.


This one is the simplest design pattern which works as a wrapper and wrap a particular object you want to wrap for any reason.
